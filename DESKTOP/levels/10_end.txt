You really did it!
-
My beautiful home,
now free of any
sign of ghosts!
-
...
-
Okay, [one] ghost.
But finally! I can
rest in peace
at long last!
-
I'm so glad I won't
have to share my
house with all of
those hoggers!
-
Now boo! I want
to be left alone.
Thank you for your
service but you
have to go.
-
Whoa whoa whoa hey!
Easy there buddy!
We're friends right?
